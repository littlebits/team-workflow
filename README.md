# Software Team Development Workflow

The workflow used by software teams at littleBits.


### git

1. Work should be done on a feature branch called `{type}/{description}`, where
`type` can be one of feature, bug, chore.
1. When ready, developer should create a pull request. This can be either once the
feature is tested and ready to deploy, or as a request for QA and/or feedback.
This should be noted in the description of the PR.
1. Developer can decide whether their feature needs a code review, or they can merge
PR themselves. Under most circumstances, feature should get a code review from
at least 1 other developer.
